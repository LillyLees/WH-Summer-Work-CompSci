## Benefits, limits, and risks of fast image recognition

### Travel and Tourism
* Possible advantages of fast image recognition could be faster check in times in places like airports, 
image recognition could be used to scan passports and faces to see if they match, as well as electronic tour guides
tour guides. The tourist could walk around the city with there phone and the phone could detect land marks and
provide pop ups informing them of where they are and interesting history. However Limits of this could be reached if someone 
had changed there physical appearance quite a lot since taking a passport photo (e.g hair style and color, piercing's, or just age), 
or if land marks are obscured by something as the tourist walks by so the computer could not register its presence. A risk could
be peoples facial data being saved and sold / leeked by the airport, or that someone accidently slips by because they were able to
trick the facial recognition. 
### Gaming and Entertainment
* Image recognition could be used in AR to scan a players surroundings and map on the game accordingly, however this could be difficult if the 
players surroundings change a lot or if they are to difficult for the AR to recognize, or if they are in a place like a completely dark
room. There are also risks of data security, that if peoples rooms are added to a data base to better improve the AI that some of it
may be leaked and things like family photos in the back round or other sensitive information could end up being sold or in the wrong hands. 
### Education and Learning
* Roll call could be done by the classes faces all quickly being scanned, and AI teachers could use fast image recognition to quickly
pick up on there classes surroundings and things like students emotions and whereabouts. Three would of course be limitations to this
such as students faces being obscured, and the complexity of a constantly changing classroom with up to 30 students perhaps being to 
much for the program to handle swiftly. There's also the risk that if the AI incorrectly marks attendance for someone or cant keep track of 
a students that something could happen to them and they could get hurt. 
### Transport and Navigation
* Image recognition could be the foundation of self driving cars, witch could give more freedom and independence to those with disability 
who couldn't drive alone otherwise, as well as massively decreasing the risk of drunk driving accidents and the like. However the cards would
have to be provided with updates on things like traffic and accidents because the image recognition would not be able to pick up on the like,
especially not soon enough. Risks could be the safety implications of a car not piking up something, if a car happens to miss the spotting of the pedestrian or other 
physical obstacles a car crash could ensue and endanger other self driving cards as well. 
### Medicine and Healthcare
* Image recognition could be used to analysis tissue samples or ex rays to quickly identify problems in the patient, 
this could decrease the time it takes for results to come back to patients and increase the acracy of diagnosis. However the limmatation is that
the acracy is wholly dependent on how well the algorithm has been made, as the algorithm is only as good as the data its been provided, 
you will only get good results if you can provide it with sufficient data. This then also gives us the risk of misdiagnosis 
or the computer seeing no problem if the program isn't accurate enough or the data base not good / big enough.
